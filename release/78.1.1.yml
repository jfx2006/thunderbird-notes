    ** Thunderbird version 78.1.1 is only offered as direct download from
    [thunderbird.net](https://www.thunderbird.net) and not as an upgrade from
    Thunderbird version 68 or earlier.**
    A future release will provide updates from earlier versions. Automatic updates
    are available for users already running version 78.0 or higher.

    Add-on support: As of version 78.0, Thunderbird only supports MailExtensions.
    Your favorite add-ons may not have been updated for compatibility.

    At this time, users of the Enigmail Add-on should **not** update to Thunderbird 78.

    OpenPGP in Thunderbird 78.1.0 has reached feature complete state, but it's still
    disabled by default, to allow more time for testing, correctness, and localization.
    See [the wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Testing)
    for how to enable and help with testing.

    **System Requirements:** [Details](/en-US/thunderbird/78.0/system-requirements/)

    - Windows: Windows 7 or later
    - Mac: macOS 10.9 or later
    - Linux: GTK+ 3.14 or higher
