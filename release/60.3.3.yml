notes:
- note: 'Thunderbird 60 will migrate security databases (key3.db, cert8.db to key4.db,
    cert9.db). Thunderbird 60.3.2 and earlier contained a fault that potentially deleted
    saved passwords and private certificate keys for users using a master password. Version
    60.3.3 will prevent the loss of data; affected users who have already upgraded to version
    60.3.2 or earlier can restore the deleted key3.db file from backup to complete the
    migration.'
