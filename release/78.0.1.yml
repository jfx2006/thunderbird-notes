    ** Thunderbird version 78.0 is only offered as direct download from
    [thunderbird.net](https://www.thunderbird.net) and not as an upgrade from
    Thunderbird version 68 or earlier.**
    A future release will provide updates from earlier versions.

    Add-on support: As of version 78.0, Thunderbird only supports MailExtensions.
    Your favorite add-ons may not have been updated for compatibility.

    At this time, users of the Enigmail Add-on should **not** update to Thunderbird 78.

    OpenPGP functionality for Thunderbird 78 is still work in progress, and is disabled
    by default in the 78.0.1 release. See [the wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Testing)
    for how to enable and help with testing.
