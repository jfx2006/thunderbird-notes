    ** Thunderbird version 78.2.0 is only offered as direct download from
    [thunderbird.net](https://www.thunderbird.net) and not as an upgrade from
    Thunderbird version 68 or earlier.**
    A future release will provide updates from earlier versions. Automatic updates
    are available for users already running version 78.0 or higher.

    Add-on support: As of version 78.0, Thunderbird only supports MailExtensions.
    Your favorite add-ons may not have been updated for compatibility.

    At this time, users of the Enigmail Add-on should **not** update to Thunderbird 78.

    Originally it was announced to enable OpenPGP by default in version 78.2.0.
    It has been decided to slightly postpone this for final changes and testing by
    volunteers. See [the wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Testing)
    for how to enable and help with testing.

    **System Requirements:** [Details](/en-US/thunderbird/78.0/system-requirements/)

    - Windows: Windows 7 or later
    - Mac: macOS 10.9 or later
    - Linux: GTK+ 3.14 or higher

  import_system_requirements: '78.0'
