- note: 'Many improvements to attachments handling during compose: Attachments can now
    be reordered using a dialog, keyboard shortcuts, or drag and drop. The "Attach" button
    moved to the right to be above the attachment pane. The access key of the attachment
    pane (e.g. Alt+M, may vary depending on localization, Ctrl+M on Mac) now also works
    to show or hide the pane. The attachment pane can also be shown initially when composing
    a new message. Right-click on the header to enable this option. Hiding a non-empty
    attachment pane will now show a placeholder paperclip to indicate the presence of attachments
    and avoid sending them accidentally.'
