  bugs:
  - 1387877
- note: In Thunderbird 54 beta a better support for Charter users was introduced. As a
    side effect, messages moved to a different IMAP folder were immediately removed from
    the source folder, even when the delete model "Just mark it as deleted" was in effect.
    This has now been restored to its pre-version 54 state, so moved IMAP messages are
    only crossed out in the source folder when this delete model is used.

  bugs:
  - 1352859
- note: 'When many Thunderbird clients or other email clients accessed the same IMAP draft
    folder, messages were sometimes sent with the wrong identity. This has been corrected
    and the user will be notified if none of their identities matches the draft. '
