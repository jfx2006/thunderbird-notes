notes:
- note: '**ADD-ON SUPPORT: Restartless add-ons continue to work if their authors have made
    the necessary minor adjustments. Non-restartless legacy add-ons using XUL overlays
    are only supported if add-on authors have adapted them. ** Apart from Lightning/Calendar
    there are a few that have been adapted, like "ThunderHTMLedit", "Compact Header" and
    "Signature Switch". Instaling legacy add-ons now requires a restart. Legacy add-ons
    can now specify an options page again.'
  tag: changed
- note: '** DICTIONARY SUPPORT: Only WebExtension dictionaries are supported now.** Please
    download new dictionaries from addons.mozilla.org since addons.thunderbird.net still
    provides "legacy" dictionaries compatible with Thunderbird 60 ESR. Note that Thunderbird
    60.5 ESR can also handle WebExtension dictionaries.'
