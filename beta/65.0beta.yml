- note: '**ADD-ON SUPPORT: Restartless add-ons continue to work if their authors have made
    the necessary minor adjustments. Non-restartless legacy add-ons using XUL overlays
    are only supported if add-on authors have adapted them. ** Apart from Lightning/Calendar
    there are a few that have been adapted, like "ThunderHTMLedit", "Compact Header" and
    "Signature Switch". Instaling legacy add-ons now requires a restart. Legacy add-ons
    can now specify an options page again.'
  tag: changed
- note: '** DICTIONARY SUPPORT: Only WebExtension dictionaries are supported now.** Please
    download new dictionaries from addons.mozilla.org since addons.thunderbird.net still
    provides "legacy" dictionaries compatible with Thunderbird 60 ESR. This may change
    as soon as Thunderbird 60 ESR can also handle WebExtension dictionaries (planned for
    version 60.5).'
